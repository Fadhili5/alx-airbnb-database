The initial query was:
```json
SELECT
    b.booking_id,
    b.property_id,
    b.user_id,
    b.start_date,
    b.end_date,
    b.total_price AS booking_total_price,
    b.status AS booking_status,
    u.first_name AS user_first_name,
    u.last_name AS user_last_name,
    u.email AS user_email,
    p.name AS property_name,
    p.description AS property_description,
    p.location AS property_location,
    p.price_per_night AS property_price_per_night,
    pay.amount AS payment_amount,
    pay.payment_date AS payment_date,
    pay.payment_method AS payment_method
FROM Booking b
JOIN "User" u ON b.user_id = u.user_id
JOIN Property p ON b.property_id = p.property_id
JOIN Payment pay ON b.booking_id = pay.booking_id;
```


**When running the initial query its perfomance was:**

```json

The potential inefficiency i noticed was that there was a lack of indexes on some join keys. 

I also added a left join here `LEFT JOIN Payment pay ON b.booking_id = pay.booking_id;` to ensure it includes bookings that might not have payment details yet.


**Final query which is optimized**
```json
SELECT
    b.booking_id,
    b.start_date,
    b.end_date,
    b.total_price,
    b.status,
    u.first_name,
    u.last_name,
    p.name AS property_name,
    pay.payment_method
FROM Booking b
JOIN "User" u ON b.user_id = u.user_id
JOIN Property p ON b.property_id = p.property_id
LEFT JOIN Payment pay ON b.booking_id = pay.booking_id
WHERE b.status = 'confirmed'
    AND b.total_price > 0
LIMIT 100;
```
